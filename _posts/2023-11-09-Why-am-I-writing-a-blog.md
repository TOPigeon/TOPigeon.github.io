# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!

<h1>Why I am writing a blog</h1>
<p>Following a recent networking event for cyber security the idea to start writing a blog entered my mind.The main benefits for me to write a blog are:
<ul>
	<li>Better clarity of writing</li>
	<li>Pratice using git and git commands</li>
	<li>Getting better with Jekyll</li>
	<li>Document technical issues and how they were resolved</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>A collection of posts documenting some technical issues I had and how I resolved them, maybe a few
posts involving productivity(time block planning) or other things I imagine would be useful enought o refer back to at some point.</p>
