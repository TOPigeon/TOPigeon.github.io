<h1>New Year, new goose</h1> 
<h3>goals for the new year<h3> 

<p>Wow, I have not posted since last year. Not much has changed since then I even managed to take some time off during the Christmas break. I do have a few goals for this year though:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Get a new job</li>
	<li>Create a post about git</li>
	<li>Develop a mobile app</li>
	<li>Become a redhat certified system administrator</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can post things along the way about the things I've learned</p>
